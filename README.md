# Quiz game made with React + Tailwind CSS
## A very simple quiz game with 4-choice questions. Get coins for every correct answer, and aim not to lose them! Have fun!
### I recommend reading the rules before you first play. After you've read the rules, click 'New game', and prepare for your first question!
#### NOTE: Coins DO transfer between playthroughs, but they DO NOT transfer between devices or browsers!
